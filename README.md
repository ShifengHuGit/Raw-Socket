# Raw-Socket
Raw Socket program using Linux and C header files which works on ethernet layer

This program works on ethernet packets,bypassing the other upper layers.

This program can be used to send and read ethernet packets between any two machines.
I used it between my ubuntu and my friend's FreeDOS which was installed in virtualbox.

You have to compile and run the program in both the machines if both are ubuntu.
If the other machine is FreeDOS then you have to write another program which I'll upload later.

The raw socket program works as a ethernet level chat server.
